    descreption: "I'm a Junior Software developer with a passion for front end development and design. I graduated from the Wifi-Wien Campus in Vienna in March 2020 as a Junior Software Developer. Since then, in September 2020, I started a basic Java course in Hungary to further expand my knowledge. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, desktop or mobile applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences. I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code.At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.",
